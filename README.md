# Earthquake Seismology Analysis  
 Author: Milind surati 
 Year: 2025  

1) Project Objective : 
This project analyzes earthquake catalogs from different seismic regions of India (Kutch, Himalaya, and Northeast India).  
The main goals are:  
- Cleaning and preparing earthquake catalog data.  
- Estimating the **b-value** of the Gutenberg–Richter relation.  
- Plotting and interpreting magnitude–frequency distributions.  
- Comparing seismicity characteristics across regions.  

 2) Data Source :
- Public earthquake catalogs from **USGS** and **India Meteorological Department (IMD)**.  

 3) Methods : 
- Data preprocessing with **Python (pandas, numpy)**.  
- Magnitude–frequency distribution analysis.  
- **b-value estimation** using maximum likelihood methods.  
- Visualization with **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.  

4) Expected Results:  
- Regional b-values for Kutch, Himalaya, and Northeast India.  
- Comparative plots of Gutenberg–Richter relations.  
- Insights into seismic hazard differences between regions.
